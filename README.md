markdown# MOTHER BRAIN - Self-Learning AI System

An autonomous AI system that learns from web data and gradually becomes independent from pre-trained models.

## Features

- **Self-Training Neural Network**: Trains on web-scale datasets to develop independent AI capabilities
- **90-Day Independence Plan**: Gradually phases out dependency on DialoGPT
- **Web-Scale Knowledge**: Learns from Common Crawl, Reddit, GitHub, and more
- **Real-Time Learning**: Feedback system that improves with every interaction
- **Planet-Wide Scanning**: Monitors 14,000+ domains for continuous learning

## Architecture
MOTHER BRAIN
â”œâ”€â”€ ConversationalModel (Current: DialoGPT)
â”œâ”€â”€ MotherTrainer (Training new model)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dataset Processing
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Vocabulary Building
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ LSTM Neural Network
â”œâ”€â”€ Search Engine (Multi-source verification)
â”œâ”€â”€ Feedback Learner (Pattern recognition)
â””â”€â”€ Knowledge Database (GitHub-backed)

## Training Progress

The system transitions from DialoGPT to custom model over 90 days:

- **Days 1-30**: Data collection & processing
- **Days 31-60**: Hybrid responses (mixing both models)
- **Days 61-90**: Full independence from DialoGPT

## API Endpoints
